Event: Wildfire
Short-Term Solutions: Deploy aerial firefighting tankers. Establish immediate evacuation zones. Set up emergency shelters for displaced residents.
Long-Term Solutions: Implement controlled burns during safe seasons to reduce fuel load. Create defensible space around properties. Upgrade early warning systems using smoke detection towers.

Event: Flood
Short-Term Solutions: Distribute sandbags to protect critical infrastructure. Issue flash flood warnings via mobile alerts. Deploy swift-water rescue teams.
Long-Term Solutions: Construct or reinforce levees and floodwalls. Improve urban drainage systems. Restore natural wetlands to absorb excess water. Prohibit new construction in high-risk floodplains.

Event: Urban Development
Short-Term Solutions: Review construction permits against zoning laws. Conduct an immediate environmental impact assessment. Monitor site for proper erosion control.
Long-Term Solutions: Integrate the new development into the city's master plan. Upgrade local infrastructure (roads, water, power) to support the new capacity. Designate nearby green spaces.

Event: Deforestation
Short-Term Solutions: Dispatch patrols to halt illegal logging activities. Use drone surveillance to monitor the affected area. Seize any equipment used for illegal clearing.
Long-Term Solutions: Launch a reforestation program with native species. Provide economic incentives for sustainable land use to local communities. Strengthen legal protections for forested areas.
